# Swiss popular initiatives in the context of time
Switzerland's system of government is unique in the world and allows for extraordinary popular participation in political decision-making. Depending on the social situation, Swiss people vote on different topics. With our interactive visualizations, we give an in-depth insight into this voting behavior.

## Implementation
<h3>Linegraph: Swiss popular initiatives since 1848</h3>
<p>At a glance, it becomes apparent which topics are most frequently discussed in society.
Social policy and the state order provide the most basis for discussion. Whereas votes on topics such as education and culture are only half as common.</p>

<h3>Word Cloud: voting patterns by issue</h3>
<p>The breakdown of subject areas by initiatives approved and rejected illustrates voting behavior over time. It becomes apparent how varied the votes are in the "fundamental rights" section but also that topics such as homosexuality are hardly taken up politically.</p>

<h3>Streamgraph: Subject area in the context of history</h3>
<p>The historical context has had a significant influence on the number of referendum proposals. Events such as wars lead to less political activity, and the postwar period, in turn, encourages it. Also notable is the increase in voting on the social policy after the 1980s.</p>
